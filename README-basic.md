- Node.js 16+ (for local development)

### Running the Application

1. **Clone and navigate to the project:**
   ```bash
   cd amazon-collab-wishlist
   ```

2. **Start the basic version:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f ops-basic/docker-compose.yml up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - API Gateway: http://localhost:8080
   - Database: localhost:5432

4. **Default credentials:**
   - Use any username/password combination (demo mode)

## 🔧 Development

### Local Development
```bash
# Start database only
docker-compose -f ops-basic/docker-compose.yml up postgres -d

# Run services locally
cd apps-basic/user-service && npm install && npm start
cd apps-basic/wishlist-service && npm install && npm start
cd apps-basic/collaboration-service && npm install && npm start
cd apps-basic/api-gateway && npm install && npm start
cd apps-basic/web-frontend && npm install && npm start
```

### Database Schema
The basic version uses a simplified schema:
- `user.user` - User accounts and profiles
- `wishlist.wishlist` - Wishlist containers
- `wishlist.wishlist_item` - Items within wishlists
- `collab.wishlist_invite` - Invitation tokens (view-only)
- `collab.wishlist_access` - User access permissions (view-only)

## 🎓 Learning Path

This basic version is designed to help you learn:

1. **Microservices Architecture** - Understanding service separation
2. **API Gateway Pattern** - Centralized routing and data enrichment
3. **JWT Authentication** - Token-based authentication
4. **Database Design** - Schema separation and relationships
5. **Service Integration** - How services communicate
6. **Basic Collaboration** - Simple sharing and invitation systems

## 🔄 Migration to Full Version

To upgrade to the full version with advanced features:

1. **Add Comments System:**
   - Create `wishlist_item_comment` table
   - Add comment endpoints to collaboration service
   - Add comment UI components

2. **Add Role-Based Access Control:**
   - Add `view_edit` and `comment_only` roles
   - Add role management endpoints
   - Add role selection in invitation UI

3. **Add Advanced Collaboration:**
   - Add permission checking for different roles
   - Add real-time features
   - Add advanced invitation options

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check if database is running
docker-compose -f ops-basic/docker-compose.yml ps

# View database logs
docker-compose -f ops-basic/docker-compose.yml logs postgres
```

**Service Startup Issues:**
```bash
# View all service logs
docker-compose -f ops-basic/docker-compose.yml logs

# Restart specific service
docker-compose -f ops-basic/docker-compose.yml restart api-gateway
```

**Port Conflicts:**
- Ensure ports 5432, 3001-3003, 8080, and 5173 are available
- Stop any existing services using these ports
